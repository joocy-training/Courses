# Courses

## A simple dotnet webapi to demonstrate containers

To run this project, simply have a container runtime available (Docker or podman, for instance) and follow the normal steps for building and running the container.

The app will be available on port 8080 (http) and exposes the usual CRUD URLs on the `/api/courses` endpoint.
